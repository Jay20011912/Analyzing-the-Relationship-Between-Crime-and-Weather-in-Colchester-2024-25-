# Analyzing-the-Relationship-Between-Crime-and-Weather-in-Colchester-2024-25-
This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and street-level crime in Colchester during the 2024–25 period by analyzing three datasets: crime2024-25.csv, temp2024-25.csv, and temp2023-24.csv. The crime dataset contains detailed records of various types of offences, including categories such as anti-social behaviour, theft, burglary, and violent crimes, along with their geographic locations and dates. The two temperature datasets provide daily climate data, including variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, collected from a nearby weather station. By combining these datasets, the project aims to identify patterns and trends that may suggest correlations between weather and crime frequency or type. The analysis is conducted using R and R Markdown, with a strong focus on clear visual representation and reproducibility. A variety of data visualization techniques are applied, including bar plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, density plots, correlation matrices, and time series charts. Interactive graphics and geospatial visualizations using tools like Leaflet are also incorporated to enhance the depth and accessibility of the analysis. Key objectives include examining whether particular crimes are more frequent during certain weather conditions, detecting seasonal patterns, and understanding how crime trends shift over time in response to climate variability. The previous year’s weather data is used to provide context and enable year-on-year comparison. The project is not only a technical exercise in data manipulation and visualization but also emphasizes narrative and interpretation to uncover meaningful insights from the data. All findings are presented within a structured HTML report generated from R Markdown, complete with explanatory text, code, and plots. Great care is taken to ensure that visual elements are informative, aesthetically clear, and well-labeled. Ultimately, this project demonstrates how environmental and social data can be integrated to provide valuable understanding of urban dynamics and public safety, using statistical tools and storytelling to support data-driven insights.
